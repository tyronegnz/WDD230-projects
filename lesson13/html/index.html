            <p class="home-paragraph">Nestled in the beautiful Oakland Hills, the Oakland Temple is considered by many
                to be the Beacon of the
                Bay. Others refer to it as the Crown Jewel of the East Bay. Its beauty can be seen from miles away. The
                temple stands as a beacon of hope, a standard of truth, and a source of strength for residents in the
                area.

                The Oakland Temple was dedicated on November 17, 1964 by President David O. McKay. The temple was the
                second in California (following the Los Angeles California Temple), and the 13th in the world. The
                temple currently serves Latter-day Saints in the Bay Area of Northern California. There are currently
                over 200 temples operating, announced or under construction throughout the world.
            </p>

            <p class="home-paragraph">
                The history of the Oakland Temple traces back to the early Mormon settlers who came to California in the
                1840’s. The first group of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arrived by sailing
                ship in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) in July 1846. 238 women, men and children disembarked from the Ship
                Brooklyn following a six month journey from New York City, around Cape Horn at the bottom of South
                America, to Hawaii, then landing at Yerba Buena on a typical foggy summer day.

                Soon after arriving in California, the settlers established the first newspaper, the first school, the
                first library and the first bank in California.
            </p>

            <p class="home-paragraph">
                The settlers laid the foundation for an economy based
                upon farming, industry and commerce in Northern California. Starting in 1848 they became an essential
                source of goods, supplies and services for gold miners who came to California following the discovery of
                gold at Coloma in January 1848.

                The quiet village of Yerba Buena was quickly transformed into the vibrant city of San Francisco. Many of
                the early settlers came across the Bay to establish residences and farms in the East Bay, including
                Oakland, Fremont and Union City, as well as areas in the Central Valley.
